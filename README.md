# Higher-lower

A very simple guessing game, built as a http API in golang.

I used the stdlib for networking, Google's UUID to generate game IDs and `go-playground`'s validator to validate basic property checks

This is a simple learning project. If you find and errors/have any suggestions, please create an issue :)
